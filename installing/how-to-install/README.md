# How to Install

The preferred method is running the exporter via Docker as it is the simplest method, though for the more technically inclined it can be run manually. Clone our repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-exporter). 

You will need a system with **more than 4 Gbs of Ram and 4 cores** for optimal performance.
