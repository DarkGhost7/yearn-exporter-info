# Yearn-Exporter-Intro

Info about the [Yearn Exporter](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-exporter) and my pre-made Dashboards for Grafana. The Yearn Exporter is a tool to output on-chain numeric data about the Yearn Vaults and feed it into Prometheus so that users can track vault statistics on a Grafana dashboard such as the ones below. If you want to add to this guide you can find it [here](https://github.com/DarkGhost7/yearn-exporter-info).
