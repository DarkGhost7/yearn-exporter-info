# yearn-exporter-info
 Info about the [Yearn Exporter](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-exporter) and my pre-made Dashboards for Grafana. The Yearn Exporter is a tool to output on-chain numeric data about the yearn vault and feed it into prometheus so that users can track vault stats (v1 and v2 vaults) on a Grafana dashboard such as the ones below.
