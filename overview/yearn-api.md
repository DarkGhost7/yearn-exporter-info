# Yearn Exporter Metrics

## exporter\_v1

Exporter for v1 Vaults. Default http server is `http://localhost:8800`. To run the `exporter_v1()` method navigate to the directory where you copied [yearn-exporter](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-exporter), open a console, and type `brownie run yearn exporter_v1 --network mainnet`.

### yearn

#### param

**`available`**

Amount of shares that are free to withdrawal without a fee. \(Liquidity in Vault - Invested in all Strategies\) 

**`base price`**

Virtual Price the vault started at.

**`boost`**

Current Boost.

**`crv apy`**

Lowest amount of CRV APY generated with 0 boost.

**`crv price`**

The current price of CRV.

**`crv reward rate`**

Curve APY \* Boost?

**`earned`**

Current amount of accumulated CRV rewards.

**`gauge balance`**

Amount of LP tokens deposited in the gauge.

**`gauge total`**

Total deposited in the gauge.

**`inflation rate`**

**`max boost`**

Max boost you can get with that % of the gauge.

**`min vecrv`**

How much veCRV you need to get max boost.

**`relative weight`**

% of all CRV rewards this curve pool gets. This weeks weights can also be viewed [here](https://dao.curve.fi/) and the future weights for next week can be viewed [here](https://dao.curve.fi/gaugeweight).

**`share price`**

getPricePerFullShare\(\)/1e18.

**`strategy balance`**

Current amount of lp tokens allocated to the strategy.

**`strategy buffer`**

From 0 to 1: with 1 meaning the vault has all liquidity allocated to strategies. ? \(minus some percent 5%?\)

**`token price`**

Base price \* virtual\_price. This is meant to provide a balance price incase the vault's base price for some reason didn't start at 1.

**`vault balance`**

Total amount of shares in the vault. \( Shares invested in Strategy + Shares not invested in Strategy\)

**`vault total`**

Total amount of shares in the whole vault 

**`vecrv balance`**

Yearn total veCRV voting power.

**`vecrv total`**

Total voting power of the Curve Dao.

**`virtual price`**

Price of the underlying curve pool

**`working balance`**

\(Gauge balance / \(2.5 \* Boost\)\) - Balance which is being rewarded.

**`working total`**

Total balance which is rewarded, from which you can calculate avg boost.
